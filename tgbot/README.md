# Telegram Bot Basics

# Prerequisites

 - python 3.7

 - TextToOwO # for following the slides

Slides and code available at [a shared GDrive location][share].

# Procedure

  1. Make a virtual environment to keep libraries separate. Be sure to
     specify the version of Python you intend to use, in this case 3.7.
     `botenv` below is the name of the environment, you can change it.

         $ virtualenv botenv --python=python3.7

  2. Now activate the virtual environment. New libraries you install
     will be kept inside here and not affect your main system.

         $ source botenv/bin/activate
